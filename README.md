# School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
Perform an analysis on student funding and standardized test scores for a city school district to determine performance trends and patterns. This analysis will help inform decisions made at the school and district level regarding school budgets and priority. The original data is modified to account for academic dishonesty that occured among ninth graders at Thomas High School. As a result all math and reading scores for every ninth grader at Thomas High School is omitted from the analysis and compared to the original results. 

## Results
